img;The diagram which is not drawn to scale, shows a horizontal rectangular surface. One corner of the surface is taken as the origin O and I and j are unit vectors along the edges of the surface.;A fly, F, starts at the point with position vector (i+12j) cm and crawls across the surface with a velocity of \[(3i+2j) cms^{-1}\]. At the instant that the fly starts crawling, a spider, S, at the surface with a velocity of \[(-5i+kj) cms^{-1}\] where k is a constant. Given that the spider catches the fly, calculate the value of k.Answers:
