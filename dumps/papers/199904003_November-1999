In a game, 2 red balls and 8 blue balls are placed in a bottle. The bottle is shaken and Mary draws 3 balls at random and without replacement. The number of read balls that she draws is denoted by R. Find the probability distribution of R, and show that $$P(R \geq 1) = \frac{8}{15}$$.  Show that the expectation of R is $$\frac{3}{5}$$ and find the variance of R.  Mary scores 4 points for each red ball that she draws. The balls are now replaced in the bottle and the bottle is shaken again. John draws 3 balls at random and without replacement. He scores 1 point for each blue ball that he draws. Mary's score is denoted by M and John's score is denoted by J. Find the expectation and variance of M-J. Answers:

A telephone enquiry service is so busy that only 80% of calls to it are successfully connected. It may be assumed that all calls are independent. Twelve calls are made at random to the service. Find the probability that at least 9 are successfully connected.   After improving the facilities, the management arranges for a random sample of 120 calls to be made to the service and it is found that 105 of these calls are successfully connected. Test, at the 4% significance level, whether the successful connection rate has improved.   A consumer association carries out its own test using a random sample of 150 calls and finds that the number of unsuccessful calls is 25. Using this sample, find an approximate 92% confidence interval for the proportion of calls that are unsuccessful.  Answers:
221: P(no. of successful calls \geq 9) = "0.795".
222: "reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at the 4% level of significance, there is " sufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the successful connection rate has improved.
223: The 92% confidence interval for q is ["0.113","0.220"].

a)  A manufacturer of rockets estimates that, on average, 1 in 75 of the rockets fail to burn properly. Using this estimate, and a Poisson distribution, find an approximate value for the probability that, out of 225 randomly chosen rockets, at most 221 burn properly.  State fully what distribution should be used to obtain the exact value of this probability. ;;b)  'Brilliant' fireworks are intended to burn for 40 seconds. A random sample of 50 'Brilliant' fireworks is taken. Each firework in the sample is ignited and the burning time, x seconds, is measured. The results are summarized by $$\Sigma(x-40) = -27$$, $$\Sigma(x-40)2=67$$. Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether the mean burning time of 'Brilliant' fireworks differs from 40 seconds.  State, with a reason, whether, in using the above test, it is necessary to assume that the burning times of 'Brilliant' fireworks have a normal distribution.   Answers:
224: P(at most 221 burn properly) = "0.353".
225: "binomial" distribution should be used to obtain the exact value of this probability. .
226: "reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that at 5% level of significance, there is " sufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the mean burning time differs from 40 seconds.

Copy the above diagram and, by sketching another graph on the same diagram, state the number of real roots of the equation 3x = f(x).

img;The diagram shows a circular table, with centre O, and three legs, AA', BB' and CC', attached at points A, B and C to the table.
