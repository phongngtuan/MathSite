A sequence $$u_1, u_2, u_3, ...$$ is such that $$u_1 = 1$$ and $$u_{n+1} = u_n - \frac{2n+1}{n^2(n+1)^2}$$ for all n > 1.;(i) Use the method of mathematical induction to prove that $$u_n = \frac{1}{n^2}$$;(ii) Hence find $$\sum^{N}_{n=1} \frac{2n+1}{n^2(n+1)^2} $$;(iii) Give a reason why the series in part(ii) is convergent and state the sum to infinity;(iv) Use your answer to part(ii) to find  $$ \sum^{N}_{n=1} \frac{2n+1}{n^2(n+1)^2} $$Answers:

A large number of students in a college have completed a geography project. The time, x hours, taken by a student to complete the project i noted for a random sample of 150 students. The result are summarized by $$ \sum x = 4626, \sum x^2 = 147691$$. ;;Find unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance.;Test, at the 5% significance level, whether the population mean time for a student to complete the project exceeds 30hours.;State, giving a reason, whether any assumptions about the population are needed in order for the test to be valid.Answers:
796: Unbiased estimate of mean, \mu = "30.84".
797: Unbiased estimate of population variance, s^2 = "33.7".
798: "reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at the 5% level of significance, there is "sufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the mean time for a student to complete the project exceeds 30hours.
799: "No assumption" (No assumption/Assumption) is needed in order for the test to be valid because the sample size is " large" (small/large), by Central Limit Theorem, the sample mean is approximately " normally" distributed.

Research is being carried out into how the concentration of a drug in the bloodstream varies with time, measured from when the drug is given. Observations at successive times give the data shown in the following table.;img;;It is given that the value of the product moment correlation coefficient for this data is -0.912, correct to 3 decimal places. The scatter diagram for the data is shown below.;img;;Calculate the equation of the regression line of x on t.;Calculate the corresponding estimated value of x when t = 300, and comment on the suitability of linear model.;The variable y is defined by $$y = \ln x$$. For the variables y and t,;(i) calculate the product moment correlation coefficient and comment on its values,;(ii) calculate the equation of the appropriate regression line.;Use a regression line to give the ebst estimate that you can of the time when the drug concentration is 15 micro grams per litre.Answers:

813: Corresponding estimated value of x when t = 300 is "-11.7".
814: "not a good" (Not a good/Good) model because the concentration of the drug in the bloddsteam cannot be " negative" (negative/positive).
815: The product moment correlation coefficient is "-0.994".
816: This indicates a "stronger" (weaker/stronger) correlation is between y and t as it is "closer" (further/closer) to 1 than the value obtained from linear model.
817: Equation of regression line of y on t is y = "-0.0123t+4.62".
