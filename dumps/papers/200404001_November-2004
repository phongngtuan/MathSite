A motor boat travels in a straight line across a river which flows at \[3ms^{-1}\] between straight parallel banks 200m apart. The motor boat, which has a top speed of \[6 ms^{-1}\] in still water, travels directly from a point A on one bank to a point B, 150 m downstream of A, on the opposite bank. Assuming that the motor boat is travelling at top speed, find, to the nearest second, the time it takes to travel from A to B .Answers:
