A plane flies from an airport A to an airport B . The position vector of B relative to A is (1200i + 240j) km, where I is a unit vector due east and j is a unit vector due north. Because of the constant wind which is blowing, the flight takes 4 hours. The velocity in still air of the plane is $$(250i + 160j) kmh^{-1}$$. Find the speed of the wind and the bearing of the direction from which the wind is blowing.Answers:
