In a sawmill, wood is cut into planks. The length of a randomly chosen plank is denoted by X m. The random variable X has a continuous uniform (rectangular) distribution on the interval $$l - 0.03 \leq x \leq l + 0.03$$, where l is a constant. Write down the probability density function of X, and hence show that the variance of X is .0003. Each day a random sample of 50 planks is taken and the total combined length of the planks is denoted by T m. By considering the approximate distribution of the sample mean, find the approximate distribution of T. Planks are intended to have a length of 2 m. Values of T are found for 5 randomly chosen days, and it is found that $$\Sigma t = 499.53$$. Test, at the 1% significance level, whether l < 2. Answers:
829: Probability density of X = "\frac{1}{0.06}", where "l - 0.03" \leq x \leq "l+0.03" or " 0", otherwise.
830: 
831: T \sim N("50l","0.015") approximately.
832: At 1% level of significance, there is "insufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that l<2.

A researcher investigates the probability p that a dropped drawing pin lands 'point-up'. She carries out n trials, where n is large. Using a normal approximation, she obtains $$0.6567 < p < 0.8100$$, correct to 4 significant figures, as a symmetric 90% confidence interval for i Find n. Test, at the 10% level of significance, where $$p > \frac{2}{3}$$. Taking the true value of p to be 0.7, find the probability that a second sequence of n trials with the drawing pin will result in precisely the number of 'point-ups' obtained by the researcher in the first sequence of n trials.Answers:
673: n = "90".
