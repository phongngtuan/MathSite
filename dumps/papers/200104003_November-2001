A company sends a leaflet to 8000 customers. The leaflet describes two offers and a special prize. The company estimates that the probability that a randomly chosen customer will claim the 'free offer' is 0.4, and that, independently, the probability that the customer will claim the 'cheap offer' is 0.2. Each free offer costs the company $5 and each cheap offer costs the company $3. Write down the expected numbers of customers claiming each offer and hence show that the expected total cost to the company is $20800. Using a suitable approximation, find the probability that the total cost to the company of the offers exceeds $20700. The company also estimates that the probability that a randomly chosen customer will claim the special prize is 0.0005. Each special prize costs the company $1000. Assuming independence, find the probability that the total cost to the company of the special prize exceeds $4000. Answers:
383: 
384: P(total cost of the offers exceeds $20700) = "0.658".
385: P(total cost of special prizes exceeds $4000) = "0.371".

A random sample of 90 batteries, used in a particular model of mobile phone, is tested and the 'standby time', x hours, is measured. The results are summarized by $$\Sigma x=3040.8$$ and $$\Sigma x^2 = 115773.66$$. Test, at the 1% significance level, whether the mean standby-time is less than 36.0 h. This type of battery is advertised as having a 'talk-time' of 5 hours. In a random sample of 50 of these batteries, 6 are found to have a talk-time of less than 5 hours. Find a 90% confidence interval for the population proportion of this type of battery that have a talk-time of less than 5 hours. In a test at the 55 significance level it is found that there is significant evidence that the population mean talk-time is less than 5 hours. ;a) There is significant evidence at the 10% significance level that the population mean talk-time is less than 5 hours.;b) There is significant evidence at the 5% significance level that the population mean talk-time is not 5 hours. ;Using only this information, and giving a reason in each case, state whether each of the following statements is;(i) necessarily true,;(ii) necessarily false, or;(iii) neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.

Sketch the graph of  $$y = \frac{6 - x}{4 - x}$$, stating the equations of the asymptotes. By first sketching the graph of a suitable function on your diagram, find an interval of the form [n, n + 1], where n is an integer, containing the larger root,  $$\alpha $$, of the equation  $$\frac{6 - x}{4 - x} = 28e^{- x} $$. Taking your value of n as the first approximation, use the Newton-Raphson process to obtain a second approximation to  $$\alpha $$. Give your answer correct to 2 places of decimals. On another diagram sketch the graph of  $$y = \left| \frac{6 - x}{4 - x} \right|$$. Use linear interpolation once, on the interval [5.5, 6], to find an approximation to a root of the equation  $$\left| \frac{6 - x}{4 - x}\right| = 28e^{- x}$$. Give your answer correct to 2 places of decimals.  Answers:
