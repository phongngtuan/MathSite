A company produces 4 types of central heating radiator, known as types A, B, C and D. A builder buys radiators for all the houses on a new estate. There are 20 small houses, 30 medium-sized houses and 15 large houses. ;A small house needs 3 radiators of type A, 2 of type B and 2 of type C. A medium-sized house needs 2 radiators of type A, 3 of type C and 3 of type D. A large house needs 1 radiator of type B, 6 of type C and 3 of type D.;The costs of the radiators are \[$30\] for type A, \[$40\] for type B, \[$50\] for type C and \[$80\] for D. Using matrix multiplication twice, find the total cost to the builder of all the radiators for the estate.Answers:
