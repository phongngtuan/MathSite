A machine grades apples according to their mass. Apples with a mass exceeding 125 g are rejected as too large and apples with a mass less than 75 g are rejected as too small. A large batch of apples is graded and it is found that 10% are rejected as too large and 13% are rejected as too small. Assuming a normal distribution, find the mean mass of a randomly chosen apple from the batch. Answers:
463: Mean mass of a randomly chosen apple = "98.4" g.

An egg producer sets a target that at least 60% of his egg production should be Grade A. In a random sample of 80 eggs, 42 are found to be Grade A. Test, at the 5% significance level, whether egg production is failing to reach the target. State what you understand by the expression 'at the 5% significance level', whether egg production is failing to reach the target. Answers:
470: "do not reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at the 5% leve of significancel, there is " insufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the farm is falling to reach the target of at least 60% eggs should be grade A..
