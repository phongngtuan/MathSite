Content:
An egg producer sets a target that at least 60% of his egg production should be Grade A. In a random sample of 80 eggs, 42 are found to be Grade A. Test, at the 5% significance level, whether egg production is failing to reach the target. State what you understand by the expression 'at the 5% significance level', whether egg production is failing to reach the target. Answers:
470: "do not reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at the 5% leve of significancel, there is " insufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the farm is falling to reach the target of at least 60% eggs should be grade A..

Content:
The mass, x kg, of the contents of each packet in a random sample of 80 cereal packets is measured, and the results are summarized by $$\Sigma x=79.53$$, $$\Sigma x^2 = 100.4621$$. Test, at the 4% significance level, whether the population mean mass of the contents is less than 1.10kg.  In another test, using the same data and also at the 4% significance level, the hypotheses are as follows. Null hypothesis: the population mean mass of the contents is equal to $$\mu_0$$ kg Alternative hypothesis: the population mean mass of the contents is not equal to $$\mu_0$$ kg Given that the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis, find the set of possible values of $$\mu_0$$. Answers:
544: "reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at 4% level of significance, there is "sufficient " (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the mean mass of the contents is less than 1.10kf.
545: \mu_0 > "1.1136" or \mu_0 < "0.8746".

Content:
The mean of a random variable X is denoted by $$\mu$$. A sample of 50 random observations of X is taken and the results are summarized by $$\sum x = 527.1$$.;(i) It is given that the population variance is 15. Carry out a 2-tail test of null hypothesis $$\mu = 9.5$$, at the 5% significance level.;(ii) It is given instead that $$\sum x^2 = 6172.31$$. In a 1-tail test of the null hypothesis $$\mu = 11.5$$, the alternative hypothesis is accepted. State the alternative hypothesis, and find an inequality that satisfied by the significance level of the test. Answers:
608: "do not reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, at the 5% leve of significance, there is "insufficient " (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that \mu \neq 9.5.
609: Significance level of test < "2.8"%.

Content:
The mass of vegetables in a randomly chosen bag has a normal distribution. The mass of the contents of a bag is supposed to be 10 kg. A random sample of 80 bags is taken and the mass of the contents of each bag, x grams, is measured. The data are summarized by  $$\Sigma (x-10000) = -2510$$,  $$\Sigma (x-10000)2 = 2010203$$ Test, at the 5% significance level, whether the mean mass of the contents of a bag is less than 10 kg. Explain, in the context of the question, the meaning of 'at the 5% significance level'. Answers:
727: "reject" (Do not reject/Reject) H_0 and conclude that, there is "sufficient" (sufficient/insufficient) evidence that the mean mass of the contents of a bag is less than 10 kg.
