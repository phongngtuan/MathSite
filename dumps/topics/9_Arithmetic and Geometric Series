A bank has an account for investors. Interest is added to the account at the end of each year at a fixed rate of 5% of the amount in the account at the beginning of that year. A man and a woman both invest money.;;a) The man decides to invest $$x$$ at the beginning of one year and then a further $$x$$ at the beginning of the second and each subsequent year. He also decides that he will not draw any money out of the account, but just leave it, and any interest, to build up.;(i) How much will there be in the account at the end of 1 year, including the interest?;(ii) Show that, at the end of n years, when the interest for the last year has been added, he will have a total of ;\[21(1.05^{n} - 1)x\] in his account.;(iii) After how many complete years will he have, for the first time, at least $$12x$$ in his account?;;b) The woman decides that, to assist her in her everyday expenses, she will withdraw the interest as soon as it has been added. She invests $$y$$ at the beginning of each year. Show that, at the end of n years, she will have received a total of \[\frac {1}{40} n(n + 1)y\] in interest.Answers:
21: At the end of 1 year, the account will have | "1.05x" |.

a) The first term of a geometric progression is 3 and the common ratio is r, where |r| < 1. The sum of the first three terms of the progression is \[\frac{8}{9}\] of the sum of the first six terms. Find the sum to infinity.;;b) All the terms of the arithmetic progression \[u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3},..., u_{n},...\] are positive. Use induction to prove that, for  \[n \geq 2\], \[\frac{1}{u_{1}u_{2}} + \frac{1}{u_{2}u_{3}} + \frac{1}{u_{3}u_{4}} + ... + \frac{1}{u_{n-1}u_{n}} = \frac{n - 1}{u_{1}u_{n}}\].Answers:

A geometric series has common ratio r, and an arithmetic series has first term a and common difference d, where a and d are non-zero. The first three terms of the geometric series are equal to the first, fourth and sixth terms respectively of the arithmetic series.;(i) Show that $$ 3r^{2}-5r+2=0$$.;(ii) Deduce that the geometric series is convergent and find, in terms of a, the sum to infinity.;(iii) The sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic series is denoted by S. Given that a > 0, find the set of possible values of n for which S exceeds 4a. Answers:
