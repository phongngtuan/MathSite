a)  Given that $$x$$ is real, prove that $$x^2 - 4x + 9$$  is always positive. Solve the inequality $$\frac{x^3 + 2 x^2 + x + 14}{x^2 + 5} > x + 1$$. ;;b) Sketch, on separate diagrams, the graphs of;(i) $$y = |x - 1|$$;(ii)$$y = |x - 1| + |x - 3|$$. Hence or otherwise find the least value of $$|x - 1| + |x - 2| + |x - 3|$$, justifying your answer. Answers:

Show that $$ \frac{2x^{2}-x-19}{x^{2}+3x+2 }-1= \frac{ x^{2}-4x-21}{x^{2}+3x+2}$$. ;Hence, without using a calculator, solve the inequality $$ \frac{2x^{2}-x-19}{x^{2}+3x+2} > 1$$.Answers:
751: 
752: Solution set of the inequality: x < "-3" or " -2" < x < " -1" or x > " 7".
