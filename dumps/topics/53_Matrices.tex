img;A toothpaste firm supplies tubes of toothpaste to 5 different stores. The number of tubes of toothpaste supplied per delivery to each store, the sizes and sale prices of the tubes, together with the number of deliveries made to each store over a 3-month period are shown in the table below.;(a)	Write down two matrices such that the elements of their product under matrix multiplication would give the volume of toothpaste supplied to each store per delivery.;(b)	Write down two matrices such that the elements of their product under matrix multiplication would give the number of tubes of toothpaste of each size supplied by the firm over the 3-month period. Find this product.;(c)	Using the matrix product found in part (b) and a further matrix, find the total amount of money which would be obtained from the sale of all the tubes of toothpaste delivered over the 3-month period.Answers:

A company produces 4 types of central heating radiator, known as types A, B, C and D. A builder buys radiators for all the houses on a new estate. There are 20 small houses, 30 medium-sized houses and 15 large houses. ;A small house needs 3 radiators of type A, 2 of type B and 2 of type C. A medium-sized house needs 2 radiators of type A, 3 of type C and 3 of type D. A large house needs 1 radiator of type B, 6 of type C and 3 of type D.;The costs of the radiators are \[$30\] for type A, \[$40\] for type B, \[$50\] for type C and \[$80\] for D. Using matrix multiplication twice, find the total cost to the builder of all the radiators for the estate.Answers:

A small manufacturing firm produces four types of product, A, B, C and D. Each product requires three processes-assembly, finishing and packaging. The number of minutes required for each type of product for each process and the cost, in $ per minute, of each process are given in the following table.;img;The firm receives an order for 40 of type A, 50 of type B, 50 of type C and 60 of type D. Write down three matrices such that matrix multiplication will give the total cost of meeting this order. Hence evaluate this total cost.Answers:
