The four faces of a red tetrahedral die are marked 1, 2, 2 and 3. The four faces of a blue tetrahedral die are marked 1, 2, 5 and 6. When such a die is thrown, the score is the number on the face on which it lands. The two dies are thrown together and their scores added. The possibility diagram in the answer space shows some of the totals. ;img ;;a-i) Complete the possibility diagram. [1];;a-ii) Find the probability that the total score is 7. [1];;b) The faces of a green tetrahedral die are marked 10, 20, 30 and 40. All three dice are thrown together and the scores added.
