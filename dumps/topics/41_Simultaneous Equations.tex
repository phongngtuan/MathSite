Ann is older than her sister,Betty. Their ages in years are such that twice the square of Betty's age subtracted from the square of Ann's age gives a number equal to 6 times the difference of their ages.; Given also that the sum of their ages is equal to 5 times the difference of their ages, find the age in years of each of the sisters.Answers:
