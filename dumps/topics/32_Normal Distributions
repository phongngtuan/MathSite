A horticulturist takes a random sample of 80 bean seeds of a particular variety, and sows them under standard laboratory conditions. The number of the seeds that germinate is 64. Find an approximate 90% confidence interval for the probability that a randomly chosen bean seed of the particular variety will germinate under the same conditions. The total crop weight, x kg, of each of the 64 plants is measured, with the following summarized results: $$\sum x = 3003.4$$  $$\sum x^{2} = 1615.96$$  . Find unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance of crop weight per plant. The horticulturist wishes to test the hypothesis that the mean crop weight per plant is 5kg, against the alternative hypothesis that the mean crop weight per plant is less than 5kg. Carry out the test at the 10% level of significance. Find the largest level of significance at which the test would result in rejection of the null hypothesis. Answers:
61: The 90% confidence interval for p is = ["0.726","0.873"].
