The equation of a curve C is $$x^3 + xy + 2 y^3 = k$$, where $$k$$ is a constant. Find  $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$ in terms of $$x$$ and $$y$$. It is given that C has a tangent which is parallel to the y-axis. ;Show that the y-coordinate of the point of contact of the tangent with C must satisfy $$216 y^6 + 4 y^3 + k = 0$$. Hence show that  $$k \leq \frac{1}{54}$$. Find the possible values of k in the case where the line x = -6 is a tangent to C. It is given instead that C has a tangent which is parallel to the x-axis. Show that $$k \leq \frac{1}{54}$$ in this case also. Answers:
108: \frac{dy}{dx} = "-(\frac{3x^2 + y}{x+6y^2})".

img;It is given that the graph of y = f(x), where \[f(x) = 2 - \frac {1}{(x-1)^2}\], is as shown above. State the equations of the asymptotes. Copy the above diagram and, by sketching another graph on the same diagram, state the number of real roots of the equation 3x = f(x). Taking x = 0.2 as a first approximation, use the Newton-Raphson method once to obtain a second approximation to a root of the equation 3x = f(x), giving your answer correct to 2 significant figures. By sketching appropriate graphs, state the number of real roots of the equation 3|x| = |f(x)|. Use linear interpolation once, on the interval [-1, 0], to obtain an approximation to a root of the equation 3|x| = |f(x)|.Answers:
233: Equations of the asymptotes are x = "1" and y = "2".
234: "1" real roots of the equation 3x = f(x).
235: Second approximation to a root of the equation 3x = f(x) is "0.18".
236: "4" real roots of the equation 3|x| = |f(x)|.
237: An approximation to a root of the equation 3|x| = |f(x)| is "-0.444".

Find the equation of the tangent to the curve  $$y = e^x $$ at the point where x = a. Hence find the equation of the tangent to the curve  $$y = e^x $$ which passes through the origin. The straight line $$y = mx$$ intersects the curve  $$y = e^x $$ in two distinct points. Write down an inequality for m. Answers:
331: Equation of the tangent to the curve y=e^{x} is y = "e^{a}(x-a+1)".
332: Equation of the tangent to the curve y=e^{x}, passing through the origin is y = "ex".
333: Inequality of m > "e".
