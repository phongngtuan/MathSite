a) The complex numbers \[2e^{\frac {1}{12} \pi i}\] and \[2e^{\frac {5}{12} \pi i}\] are represented by the points A and B respectively in an Argand diagram with origin O. Show that triangle OAB is equilateral.;;b) The complex numbers z and w each have modulus R, and have arguments \[\alpha\] and \[\beta\] respectively, where \[0 < \alpha < \beta < \frac {1}{2} \pi\]. In either order,;(i) show that \[z + w = 2R \left \{ \cos \frac {1}{2} (\beta - \alpha) \right \}e^{\frac {1}{2}(\alpha + \beta)i}\],;(ii) express |z + w| and arg (z + w) in terms of R, \[\alpha\] and \[\beta\], as appropriate. Show also that \[|z - w| = 2R\sin \frac {1}{2}(\beta - \alpha)\]. The complex numbers z and w are represented by the points Z and W respectively in an Argand diagram with origin O. Triangle OZW has area \[\Delta\]. Show that \[|z^2 - w^2| = 4\Delta \].Answers:
